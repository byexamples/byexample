The # is a Shell prompt but also a comment in Python and Ruby
The >>> is a Python prompt and >> and # >> are valid Ruby prompts

The following is ambiguous because it could be a Shell or a Ruby
example

# >> 1 + 2
err

It is ambiguous even if one is larger than the other (the Shell
example spans 2 lines, the first Ruby example just 1)

# >> 1 + 2
>>

This case is not ambiguous: the first example is in Ruby and spans
2 lines, the "second" should be a Shell example of 1 line but we
consider take the first example as valid.

>> puts "# 1 + 2"
# 1 + 2

If those two are actually two examples, we could print a warning
saying that the Ruby example is shadowing the Shell example, "put
and extra line in between them".

# Extending ``byexample``

Currently we support:

 - Python (compatible with ``doctest``) -> [docs](https://byexamples.github.io/byexample/languages/python)
 - Ruby -> [docs](https://byexamples.github.io/byexample/languages/ruby)
 - Javascript -> [docs](https://byexamples.github.io/byexample/languages/javascript)
 - Shell (``sh`` and ``bash``) -> [docs](https://byexamples.github.io/byexample/languages/shell)
 - GDB (the [GNU Debugger](https://www.gnu.org/software/gdb/download/)) -> [docs](https://byexamples.github.io/byexample/languages/gdb)
 - C++ (using [cling](https://github.com/root-project/cling) - *experimental*) -> [docs](https://byexamples.github.io/byexample/languages/cpp)

But don't get limited to those.

You can extend ``byexample`` adding:
 - new ways to find examples
 - support new languages and interpreters
 - new reports and other things

Check out [how to support new finders and languages](how-to-support-new-finders-and-languages.md)
and [how to hook to events with concerns](how-to-hook-to-events-with-concerns.md) for more info.

It is easier than you think!

# Quick Example in Markdown

Write your Markdown as usual, putting you examples
inside of a Markdown Fenced-Code block or a HTML Comment block.

### Markdown Fenced-Code block

```python
This is a Python example:

>>> 1 + 2
3
```

### HTML Comment block

Or inside of a HTML Comment block (because it is ignored
you will not see it):

<!--
>>> 2 + 2
4
-->

### Final comments

> This is not a Javascript example
>> Nor this a Ruby example
